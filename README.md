# Hopfield Network

This project implements a Hopfield Network, a type of recurrent artificial neural network that serves as a content-addressable memory system with binary threshold nodes. Hopfield Networks are used for associative memory, pattern recognition, and solving optimization problems.

## Features

- Implementation of Hopfield Network in Python
- Pattern storage and retrieval
- Demonstration of associative memory
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy (for matrix operations)
- Matplotlib (for visualization, if used)

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `hopfiled_network.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells to see the Hopfield Network in action.

## Usage

- Store binary patterns in the network.
- Retrieve stored patterns from noisy or incomplete inputs.
- Visualize the convergence process and results.

## Example

The notebook demonstrates:

- How to encode patterns
- How the network recalls stored patterns from noisy inputs
- Visualization of pattern retrieval
